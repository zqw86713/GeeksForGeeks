Count triplets in a sorted doubly linked list whose sum is equal to a given value x
Given a sorted doubly linked list of distinct nodes(no two nodes have the same data) and a value x. Count triplets in the list that sum up to a given value x.

Method 3 Efficient Approach(Use of two pointers):
Traverse the doubly linked list from left to right. For each current node during the traversal, initailze two pointers first = pointer to the node next to the current node and last = pointer to the last node of the list. Now, count pairs in the list from first to last pointer that sum up to value (x â€“ current nodeâ€™s data) (algorithm described in this post). Add this count to the total_count of triplets. Pointer to the last node can be found only once in the beginning.
