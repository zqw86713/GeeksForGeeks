/*	In binary search, we look for an element x in a sorted array by first comparing x to the midpoint of the array.
If xis less than the midpoint, then we search the left half of the array. If x is greater than the midpoint, then
we search the right half of the array. We then repeat this process, treating the left and right halves as subarrays.
Again, we compare x to the midpoint of this subarray and then search either its left or right side. We
repeat this process until we either find x or the subarray has size 0.
